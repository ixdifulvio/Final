# Papua New Guinea
This is my final project on Papua New Guinea

## Project 1

1. [Administrative Subdivisions of Papua New Guinea](https://github.com/ixdifulvio/workshop/blob/master/png.png)(Feb.20)
   This is a map of Papua New Guinea with administrative level 1 and 2 labeled.
2. [Population of Papua New Guinea Extracted from a Raster](https://github.com/ixdifulvio/workshop/blob/master/png_pop19.png)(Feb.20)
   This is a map of Papua New Guidea that contains the country's population density. 
3. [Geometric Bar Plot with my Simple Feature Object](https://github.com/ixdifulvio/workshop/blob/master/Papua_plots.png)(Feb.20)
   This is the project 1 individual deliverable. It is a map that illustrates of the population density of Papua New Guinea in 2019 with a bar plot of each first administrative district's population as a percent of the total population. I did not produce any of the stretch goals for Papua New Guinea because I spent the first two weeks of class trying to subset China, which later became too difficult. I did manage to create a plot of Xinjiang, China--which was part of the individual stretch goal 2 in part 1 of project 1. Following the instructions in github worked well for Papua New Guinea, so I did not have to make many changes nor did I encounter many obstacles. Papua New Guinea's population is concentrated in the northern part of the nation. However, the capital of Papua New Guinea, Port Moseby, is one of the less populated areas. This is because the capital was placed here to benefit white colonizers, since it was the primary port for trade. The majority of the indigenous population lives in the highlands, which is the most populated areas, according to my maps.

## Project 2

1. [Modeling and Predicting Spatial Data](https://github.com/ixdifulvio/workshop/blob/master/PNG_p2p1map.png)(April.6)
   This plot above shows the difference between the population predicted by the model and the actual population in 2015 for Haiti. The population of the reddish part is underpredicted.

## Project 3

1. [Population per grid cell throughout Papua New Guinea](https://github.com/ixdifulvio/workshop/blob/master/rigo_pop19.png)(April.19)
This is a plot of Rigo which is a district within the Central Provice of Papua New Guinea. With many island nations, inland areas tend to be less developed, since they are further away from shipping ports and resources obtained from the oceans. Rigo is a remote inland district, so it is sparsly populated with a population of 56,509. Additionally, Rigo is in the same province as the capital of Papua New Guinea, which is Port Moresby. And, most of Rigo's population is located towards the southern part of the district, which is cloxer in proximity to developed areas near Port Moresby. 
2. [Spatial Probability Density Function of Rigo, Papua New Guinea](https://github.com/ixdifulvio/workshop/blob/master/rigo_density_image.png)(April.19)
I had some issues with getting this graph because I first started with a different district in Papua New Guinea called Kairuku, which had a population of 121,586. My computer had difficulties calculating the bandwith. Because of this, I switched to a district with a smaller population. Then after switching to Rigo, I ran into a different issue with running with `countourLines()` function and had to adjust the levels to 260000 instead of 1000000.
3. [Urbanized Areas throughout Rigo, Papua New Guinea](https://github.com/ixdifulvio/workshop/blob/master/urban_areas_rigo.png)(April.19)
This is a plot of the urban areas with their respective population and densities in Rigo, Papua New Guinea. The highest population density is located towards the southern and western part of Rigo. This concentration of population near the western and southern ares indicate that people tend to live closer to more populated districts. To the west of Rigo lies Kairuku and the coast of Papua New Guinea, which allows people access to more resources and people. Furthermore, population clustered towards the south is closer to the the coast and the Abau District. 
4. [Roadways throughout Rigo, Papua New Guinea](https://github.com/ixdifulvio/workshop/blob/master/rigo_roadways.png)
This is a plot of the roadways in Rigo, Papua New Guinea. There were seven types of identified roadways in Rigo. In my plot, I designated paths to be colored brown, residential roads to be colored red, service roads to be colored blue, tertiary roads to be colored gray, tracks to be colored olive, trunk roads to be colored plum, and unclassified roads are colored cyan. From the map, it appears that unclassified roads and trunk roads are most prevalent with some tracks coming off of the trunk roads and unclassified roads. Additionally, there are small spots with slivers of residential roads. Furthermore, there appears to be a long tertiary road that cuts through the bottom right half of Rigo. 
5. [Buildings throughout Rigo, Papua New Guinea](https://github.com/ixdifulvio/workshop/blob/master/rigo_buildings_roads.png)
This is a plot of buildings in Rigo, Papua New Guinea. HDX defines buildings as any structure with roof. Since these buildings are not educational facilities or healthcare facilities, they are either offices or homes. All of the buildings are located near the southern and western part of Rigo, which is logical because most of the population in Rigo is concetrated in the southern and western parts of the district.
